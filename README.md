# ChatterBox

## Description
This is a really simple real time chat app called ChatterBox. Users are welcome to enter their username, and select a chat room to join. They can then chat with their friends in real-time!

## Purpose
I wanted to get my hands dirty with socket.io. My goal was to get practice, and a good understanding of socket.io so that I can implement this technology in a real-time multiplayer game for a future personal project.
